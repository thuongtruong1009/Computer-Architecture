Problem 1.
  CPI: Use weighted average CPI formula in slide 1
  IPC: Inverse of CPI
Problem 2.
  n: Instruction count
  t: Execution time
  MIPS = n / (t * 10^6)
  t = 
Problem 3.
  a.
  3GHz: 3*10^9 cycle/second
  -> 1 second : 3*10^9 cycles <-- n
  Instruction = Instruction / cycle * cycle = 1 / (Cycle / Instruction)
* n = 1 / CPI * n
  b.
  Time used in polling the mouse in 1 secone ~ Execution time (t) in 1 second
  t = Instruction count / IPC * Cycle time = 200 * 30 / (1 / CPI) * (1 / Clock
rate)
Problem 4.
  a.
  t1 = t2 (use formula for execution time)
  => M2's clock rate
  b.
  Same clock rate, same number of instructions, same ISA -> Compare average(average
weighed CPI) (equal runs of P1 and P2 -> 50% avgCPI(P1) + 50% avg(CPI(P2)))
  c. M1 and M2 has the same x%avgCPI(M1) + (100-x)%avgCPI(M2) -> solve for x
Problem 6.
  Refer to MIPS formula
Problem 7.
  Use formula at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law, make a graph for
p = 1% -> 25%
Problem 8.
  a. Again, use Amdahl's Law and calculate limit of S when s -> infinity(I hope
you remember Calculus 1)
  b. c. Just do some algebric manipulation to get the results
Problem 9.
  a. b. c. d. Reread textbook (1.9)
Problem 10.
  (I'm still working on this)
