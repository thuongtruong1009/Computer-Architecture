## Introducing
For a new developer, MIPS is look like a machine language. It differs from other advanced languages in a number of ways. I'll expose you to the first lines of MIPS code in the first project. It's not as difficult as you would have imagined. Have enjoy it!
I have been provided MIPS code for Lab6 that is structure for Stack in programming. Stack exception is look like the stacking plates and when we add() a new element to the top vertex and at some point we will get some element out also from its top vertex. It's pop() and peek() method. We will learn it in future. Stack has the exact opposite way of working with a queue.
